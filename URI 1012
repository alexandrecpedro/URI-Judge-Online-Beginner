Area

Make a program that reads three floating point values: A, B and C. Then, calculate and show:
a) the area of the rectangled triangle that has base A and height C.
b) the area of the radius's circle C. (pi = 3.14159)
c) the area of the trapezium which has A and B by base, and C by height.
d) the area of the square that has side B.
e) the area of the rectangle that has sides A and B.

Input: The input file contains three double values with one digit after the decimal point.

Output: The output file must contain 5 lines of data. Each line corresponds to one of the areas described above, always with a corresponding message 
(in Portuguese) and one space between the two points and the value. The value calculated must be presented with 3 digits after the decimal point.

var input = require('fs').readFileSync('/dev/stdin', 'utf8');

var [A, B, C] = input.split(' ').map(item => parseFloat(item));
var pi = 3.14159;

var areaRectTriangle = A*C/2.0;
var areaCircle = pi*(Math.pow(C,2));
var areaTrapezium = (A+B)*C/2.0;
var areaSquare = Math.pow(B,2);
var areaRectangle = A*B;

console.log('TRIANGULO: ' + areaRectTriangle.toFixed(3));
console.log('CIRCULO: ' + areaCircle.toFixed(3));
console.log('TRAPEZIO: ' + areaTrapezium.toFixed(3));
console.log('QUADRADO: ' + areaSquare.toFixed(3));
console.log('RETANGULO: ' + areaRectangle.toFixed(3));
