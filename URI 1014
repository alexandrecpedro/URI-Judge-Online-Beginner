Consumption

Calculate a car's average consumption being provided the total distance traveled (in Km) and the spent fuel total (in liters).

Input: The input file contains two values: one integer value X representing the total distance (in Km) and the second one is a floating point number Y  
representing the spent fuel total, with a digit after the decimal point.

Output: Present a value that represents the average consumption of a car with 3 digits after the decimal point, followed by the message "km/l".

var input = require('fs').readFileSync('/dev/stdin', 'utf8');

const [distanceTraveled, spentFuel] = input.split('\n');

var averageConsumption = distanceTraveled/spentFuel;

console.log(averageConsumption.toFixed(3) + ' km/l');
